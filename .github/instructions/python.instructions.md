# Python Code Style Guide
- Use single quotes for strings.
- Use snake_case for variable and function names.
- Include docstrings for all public functions and classes.
- Prefer constants over variables for immutable values.
- Use list comprehensions for concise array transformations.
- Include error handling in all async functions.
- Use f-strings for string formatting.
- Use type hints for function parameters and return types.
- Use `with` statements for file handling.
- Use `enumerate` for iterating over lists with index.
- Use `try` and `except` for error handling.
- Use `if __name__ == '__main__':` for script entry points.
- Use `import` statements at the top of the file.
- Use `isinstance` for type checking.
- `requirements.txt` should be used for package dependencies and the version should be pinned.
